# arkhipov2018_layer4

This repository contains code for building, simulating, and analyzing the models of the Layer 4 of mouse V1, as described in the publication "Visual physiology of the Layer 4 cortical circuit in silico" by Arkhipov et al., https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/31/292839.

The code is provided solely for the purpose of reproducing the results of the above publication.

We are not currently supporting this code, but simply releasing it to the community AS IS but are not able to provide any guarantees of support. The community is welcome to submit issues, but you should not expect an active response.

If you would like to develop your own new models and run simulations using the approach similar to the Arkhipov et al. Layer 4 publication, we encourage you to use the more recently developed and actively supported tool, the Brain Modeling ToolKit:

The code in this repository is organized in directories SI_1 to SI_5, according to the supplementary information of the Arkhipov et al. publication.

Each directory contains a file README.txt, which describes the contents of the directory and provides instructions for using the code.
